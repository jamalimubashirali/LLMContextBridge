# LLMContextBridge

**A Universal Memory Layer for Large Language Models (LLMs)**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**LLMContextBridge** is a secure, user-controlled system that enables you to **fetch past AI conversations** from one LLM platform (e.g., ChatGPT), and **inject them as context** into another LLM (e.g., Claude, Gemini, or custom models). This unlocks seamless cross-platform AI memory sharing, improving personalization, continuity, and reasoning across different chatbots.

---

## 🎯 Why LLMContextBridge?

- Most AI chatbots operate in silos — your conversations are trapped inside each platform.
- Users frequently switch between multiple LLMs but cannot carry their prior AI interactions across.
- Copy-pasting context is inefficient, manual, and error-prone.
- LLMContextBridge creates a **universal chat memory layer** for effortless, secure context sharing.

---

## 🔐 Key Features

- **Secure OAuth2 Authorization** — Users grant selective access to conversation histories.
- **Conversation Fetching** — Access your stored chats directly from platforms like OpenAI.
- **Context Slicing** — Choose full or partial conversations to reuse.
- **Cross-LLM Context Injection** — Seamlessly embed past chats into any LLM via API or UI.
- **Optional Semantic Search** — Use vector embeddings for smarter context retrieval.

## 🧱 Architecture

```plaintext
[OpenAI / ChatGPT]  <-- OAuth + API -->  [LLMContextBridge UI/Backend]  <-- Context Injection -->  [Target LLM (Claude, Gemini, etc.)]
```

# ⚙️ How It Works
Authenticate with your source LLM platform (e.g., OpenAI) via OAuth.
- Fetch and browse your conversation history.
- Select conversations or chat snippets to export.
- Inject the selected context into your target LLM session to provide it prior chat context.
- Interact with the target LLM enriched with your full conversation history.

# 📈 Potential Use Cases
- Continuing a conversation started on ChatGPT within Claude.
- Cross-agent multi-model workflows in enterprise AI.
- Personal AI assistants with persistent memory across platforms.
- Developers building multi-agent or context-aware AI apps.

# 🛠️ MVP Tech Stack (Example)
- Frontend: React + OAuth2 flow for authentication
- Backend: Node.js or Python FastAPI to handle API calls & data formatting
- Storage: Optionally, encrypted user storage or direct fetch from LLM provider
- APIs: OpenAI API for chat history + Target LLM API for context injection

# 🤝 Who Should Care?
- AI platform providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind)
- Multi-agent AI framework creators (LangChain, AgentOps)
- Developers building personalized AI experiences
- Users managing multiple AI assistants
